# portfolio-microservice

This microservice is written with the intention of serving as the backend service for my personal portfolio website.
If someone is interested in using this, it is written in Golang and accesses a MongoDB cluster to retrieve and store information to be pushed towards my blog.

Godeps are already setup and can easily deploy the microservice to somewhere like Heroku.
